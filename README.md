### Alpas - The Rapid and Delightful Kotlin Web Framework. Easy, elegant, and productive! ðŸš€

> This app is built by following [Let's build a web app from scratch to finish with Alpas + Kotlin][devto-tutorial] tutorial.

Alpas is a batteries-included web framework for Kotlin with a strong focus on developers' productivity.
The main goal of Alpas is to get you started quick and enable you to move faster while
letting you enjoy doing what you are the best at â€” crafting a delightful web app.

Alpas strives to be simple and elegant and wants to serve you whether you have written any JVM based web
apps before or notâ€”there is no xml or properties file to configure, no scattered annotations
to memorizeâ€”and yet, there is no huge learning curve to get started.

Alpas comes bundled with most of what you need to write modern web appsâ€”**authentication**,
**auth scaffolding**, **email verification**, **notifications**, **mail**, **queues**,
**fast and intuitive routing**, **powerful templating engine** etc.â€”and yet it
remains flexible for you to extend it to make it more powerful and
delightful than it already is.

We have sweated picking the good parts, so you donâ€™t have to!
